# DeepRL-for-Portfolio-Management

The notebook contains the application of various Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms to the problem of managing a financial portfolio with the objective maximize the return. The tested algorithms are:
-Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)
-Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
-Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (TD3)
